typeahead.js
============

Inspired by [twitter.com]'s autocomplete search functionality, typeahead.js is
a flexible JavaScript library that provides a strong foundation for building
robust typeaheads.

This is a fork of [twitter.com](https://twitter.com)'s autocomplete search library, [typeahead.js](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js).

**Note:** This fork adds ARIA roles/attributes to help assistive software (e.g. JAWS)
